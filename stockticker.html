                <h3>Stocks</h3>
                <p> Stocks are securities that represent an ownership share in a company. For companies, issuing stock is a way to raise money to grow and invest in their business. For investors, stocks are a way to grow their money and outpace inflation
                    over time. <br>When you own stock in a company, you are called a shareholder because you share in the company's profits. <br>Public companies sell their stock through a stock market exchange, like the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange.
                    Investors can then buy and sell these shares among themselves through stockbrokers. The stock exchanges track the supply and demand of each company's stock, which directly affects the stock's price. <br>Stock prices fluctuate throughout
                    the day, but investors who own stock hope that over time, the stock will increase in value. Not every company or stock does so, however: Companies can lose value or go out of business completely. When that happens, stock investors
                    may lose all or part of their investment. That's why it's important for investors to spread their money around, buying stock in many different companies rather than focusing on just one.</p>
